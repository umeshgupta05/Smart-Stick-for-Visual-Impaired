## Components Used  
1. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Detects obstacles by emitting and receiving ultrasonic waves.  
2. **Arduino Board**: Serves as the central controller to process data from the sensor and manage outputs.  
3. **Vibration Motor**: Provides varying intensity feedback based on obstacle proximity.  
4. **Switch**: Allows the user to activate the buzzer in case of emergencies.  
5. **Buzzer**: Produces an audible alert for emergency signaling.  
6. **Power Supply**: Powers all the components.

## Working Principle  
1. The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to obstacles by calculating the time it takes for emitted ultrasonic waves to bounce back.  
2. The Arduino processes the sensor data and adjusts the vibration motor's intensity based on the obstacle's proximity.  
3. The user feels the vibration and adjusts their movement accordingly.  
4. In an emergency, the user can press the switch to activate the buzzer, which emits a loud sound to alert nearby individuals.
